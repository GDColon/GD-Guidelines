Song BPM:             100
Song Length (secs):   300
Song Offset (ms):     0
Color Pattern:        G Y Y Y

=================

Change the values above (Not Below) to whatever fits the song you're using
- BPM can be calculated at sites such as https://www.all8.com/tools/bpm/
- Song offset is how long before the pattern begins (in case the song starts with silence)
- Color pattern determines the color of the guidelines (e.g "G Y G" would repeat a pattern of green, yellow, green)
- For patterns, available line colors are G, Y, O, and X. (green, yellow, orange, none). Using anything else will just skip that line entirely

To use: Make sure node.js is installed then type "node lines.js" in the console or just click on run.bat

Guidelines will be applied to whichever level is at the top of your created list
I didn't do much testing with this thing so you might want to back up or copy your level before using it!
